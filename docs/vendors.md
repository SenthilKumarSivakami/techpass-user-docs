Please inform your vendor to use his account if it is an existing user account.
Contact TechPass if the account is disabled due to inactivity.

?> The invited vendor would receive an email indicating the **username** and a phone SMS for the **password**

You can then proceed to add the vendor as a [co-admin](namespaces#Managing-Tenant-Admins) or add as an [application user](applications#Managing-Access-to-your-App)!
